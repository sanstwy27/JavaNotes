## Design Pattern

#### 1. Seven Principles of Java Design Pattern

- SOLID
  - The **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
    - Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.
  - The **O**pen/Closed Principle
    - Classes and other entities should be open for *extension* but closed for *modification*.
  - The **L**iskov Substitution Principle (Richter substitution principle)
    - Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes.
  - The **I**nterface Segregation Principle
    - Interfaces should be client specific rather than general.
  - The **D**ependency Inversion Principle
    - Depend on abstractions rather than concretions.
- Demeter's Law
  - it is also called [Least know the law], an  object should maintain a minimum understanding of other objects, the closer the relationship between class and class, the higher the degree of coupling
- Principles of composite reuse
  - Try to use synthetic aggregation, and use less inheritance, programming for the interface instead of programming for the implementation.
