# BlockingQueue extends Collection
- **ArrayBlockingQueue**：A bounded blocking queue backed by an array.
- **LinkedBlockingQueue**：A bounded blocking queue backed by a linked list. (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
- PriorityBlockingQueue：An unbounded blocking queue that uses the same ordering rules as class PriorityQueue and supplies blocking retrieval operations.
- DelayQueue：An unbounded blocking queue of Delayed elements, in which an element can only be taken when its delay has expired.
- **SynchronousQueue**：A blocking queue in which each insert operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another thread, and vice versa.
- LinkedTransferQueue：An unbounded TransferQueue based on linked nodes.
- LinkedBlockingDeque：An optionally-bounded blocking deque based on linked nodes.
